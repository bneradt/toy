# word\_ladder

## Description
Create a word ladder given the first and last steps on the ladder and the
number of steps in the ladder (not inclusive of the first step).

For example, given the following:

parameter  | value
---------  | -----
first step | "hawk"
last step: | "park"
num steps: | 2

A ladder that satisfies these values is:

1. hawk
1. hark
1. park

## Word List

The set of dictionary words can be passed in via `--word-file`. If one is not
passed in, the included `words_dictionary.zip` file is used. For reference, I
got this file from here:
